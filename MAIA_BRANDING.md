### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
*"Maia is a student support platform that brings together all the tools SSS teams need in one place. It manages multi-tiered interventions, tracks student progress, ensures protocol compliance for bullying and child protection cases, and integrates with Google Calendar and Forms. Named after the Pleiades star, Maia helps us illuminate each student's pathway to success."*

### Short Pitch (2 minutes)
*"Right now, our SSS work happens across Excel, Google Forms, Word docs, and email. Maia brings everything into one intelligent system. Teachers can submit referrals easily, SSS staff can track interventions and sessions, protocol steps are guided automatically, and we can measure real progress. It's designed specifically for how we work, includes smart AI analysis powered by Claude, and works offline when our internet goes down. The system is named Maia—after both the Pleiades star and my daughter—because it represents our mission: to guide every student toward success."*
